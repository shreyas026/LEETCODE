# 1344. Angle Between Hands of a Clock
# ======================================
# Difficulty: Medium
#
# Given two numbers, `hour` and `minutes`, return *the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the *`hour`* and the *`minute`* hand*.
#
# Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
#
#  
#
# **Example 1:**
#
# []
#
# **Input:** hour = 12, minutes = 30
# **Output:** 165
#
# ```
#
# **Example 2:**
#
# []
#
# **Input:** hour = 3, minutes = 30
# **Output:** 75
#
# ```
#
# **Example 3:**
#
# []
#
# **Input:** hour = 3, minutes = 15
# **Output:** 7.5
#
# ```
#
#  
#
# **Constraints:**
#
# 	
# - `1 &lt;= hour &lt;= 12`
# 	
# - `0 &lt;= minutes &lt;= 59`
#
# ====== SOLUTION ======

class Solution:
    def angleClock(self, hour: int, minutes: int) -> float:
        minute_angle = minutes * 6
        hour_angle = (hour % 12) * 30 + minutes * 0.5
        
        diff = abs(hour_angle - minute_angle)
        return min(diff, 360 - diff)
