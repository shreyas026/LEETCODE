# 3838. Weighted Word Mapping
# =============================
# Difficulty: Easy
#
# You are given an array of strings `words`, where each string represents a word containing lowercase English letters.
#
# You are also given an integer array `weights` of length 26, where `weights[i]` represents the weight of the `i^th` lowercase English letter.
#
# The **weight** of a word is defined as the **sum** of the weights of its characters.
#
# For each word, take its weight modulo 26 and map the result to a lowercase English letter using reverse alphabetical order (`0 -&gt; &#39;z&#39;, 1 -&gt; &#39;y&#39;, ..., 25 -&gt; &#39;a&#39;`).
#
# Return a string formed by concatenating the mapped characters for all words in order.
#
#  
#
# **Example 1:**
#
# **Input:** words = [&quot;abcd&quot;,&quot;def&quot;,&quot;xyz&quot;], weights = [5,3,12,14,1,2,3,2,10,6,6,9,7,8,7,10,8,9,6,9,9,8,3,7,7,2]
#
# **Output:** &quot;rij&quot;
#
# **Explanation:**
#
# 	
# - The weight of `&quot;abcd&quot;` is `5 + 3 + 12 + 14 = 34`. The result modulo 26 is `34 % 26 = 8`, which maps to `&#39;r&#39;`.
# 	
# - The weight of `&quot;def&quot;` is `14 + 1 + 2 = 17`. The result modulo 26 is `17 % 26 = 17`, which maps to `&#39;i&#39;`.
# 	
# - The weight of `&quot;xyz&quot;` is `7 + 7 + 2 = 16`. The result modulo 26 is `16 % 26 = 16`, which maps to `&#39;j&#39;`.
#
# Thus, the string formed by concatenating the mapped characters is `&quot;rij&quot;`.
#
# **Example 2:**
#
# **Input:** words = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;], weights = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
#
# **Output:** &quot;yyy&quot;
#
# **Explanation:**
#
# Each word has weight 1. The result modulo 26 is `1 % 26 = 1`, which maps to `&#39;y&#39;`.
#
# Thus, the string formed by concatenating the mapped characters is `&quot;yyy&quot;`.
#
# **Example 3:**
#
# **Input:** words = [&quot;abcd&quot;], weights = [7,5,3,4,3,5,4,9,4,2,2,7,10,2,5,10,6,1,2,2,4,1,3,4,4,5]
#
# **Output:** &quot;g&quot;
#
# **Explanation:​​​​​​​**
#
# The weight of `&quot;abcd&quot;` is `7 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 19`. The result modulo 26 is `19 % 26 = 19`, which maps to `&#39;g&#39;`.
#
# Thus, the string formed by concatenating the mapped characters is `&quot;g&quot;`.
#
#  
#
# **Constraints:**
#
# 	
# - `1 &lt;= words.length &lt;= 100`
# 	
# - `1 &lt;= words[i].length &lt;= 10`
# 	
# - `weights.length == 26`
# 	
# - `1 &lt;= weights[i] &lt;= 100`
# 	
# - `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
